This is an automated Email sender which uses smtp libraries of python.
Here config.py is an python file, which has the EmailAddress and the password of the Sender which needs to be Set first and then run the automatedEmail.py file.
This is set for gmail users only, can be changed by changing smtp name and portnumber.
For a sender he needs to agree for the gmails security policies and go to this link  https://myaccount.google.com/lesssecureapps?pli=1 and ON the Allow less secure Apps.
And then it is good to go.
